2 - Pre-fecth all the results and then use the Material UI library component https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/ to set up the auto-complete functionality.
3 - Use the Table component from MUI to set this up https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#data-table

# Activity 3

1 - Use postgresql to set up the DB and seed it using knex - https://knexjs.org/. Main idea is to use the keys as the table values hwoever could also user 3 tables, one for name, one for Land Cover and the last one for Protected Areas
2 - User knex to do the database calls
3 - Set up CRUD endpoints to facilitate the operations.

# Considerations

1 - Set up the create and update operations so that they are done as transactions
